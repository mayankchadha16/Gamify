It is necessary to run the ipynb files located in the Code folder in the specified sequence assigned to them, which is denoted by the numerical prefix in their filename. Specifically, the files should be executed in ascending order of the numerical prefix assigned to them, starting with 01_file1.ipynb and proceeding sequentially to the last file in the sequence. This sequence is important to ensure that the desired results are obtained from the code.
